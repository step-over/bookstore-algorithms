# bookstore-algorithms

This project uses classical algorithms and data structures to solve simple, real-world inspired problems in a bookstore system.

The goal of the project is to show how different algorithmic techniques can be applied to common tasks such as organizing data, searching efficiently, and modeling relationship between entities. 

The problems covered in this project include:
- organizing the bookstore catalog
- finding a book quickly
- indexing and inserting books as new stock arrives
- optimizing supply and restocking routes

The project focuses on clarity, correctness, and basic performance considerations rather than advanced optimizations.
