# bookstore-algorithms

This project uses classical algorithms and data structures to solve simple, real-world inspired problems in a bookstore system.

The goal of the project is to show how different algorithmic techniques and data structures can be chosen to model and solve common problems such as organizing data, searching efficiently, and representing relationships between entities.

The problems covered in this project include:
- organizing the bookstore catalog
- finding a book quickly
- organizing book categories using hierarchical structures
- optimizing supply and restocking routes

The project focuses on simplicity, correctness, and clear data modelling rather than advanced optimizations.
